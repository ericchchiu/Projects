## Problem Statement
Movie reviews are an important way to gauge the performance of a movie. While providing a numerical/stars rating to a movie tells us about the success or failure of a movie quantitatively, a collection of movie reviews is what gives us a deeper qualitative insight on different aspects of the movie. A textual movie review tells us about the the strong and weak points of the movie and deeper analysis of a movie review can tell us if the movie in general meets the expectations of the reviewer.
## Significance of the Problem Statement 
Sentiment Analysis is a major subject in machine learning which aims to extract subjective information from the textual reviews. The field of sentiment of analysis is closely tied to natural language processing and text mining. It can be used to determine the attitude of the reviewer with respect to various topics or the overall polarity of review. Using sentiment analysis, we can find the state of mind of the reviewer while providing the review and understand if the person was “happy”, “sad”, “angry” and so on. In this project we aim to use Sentiment Analysis on a set of movie reviews given by reviewers and try to understand what their overall reaction to the movie was, i.e. if they liked the movie or they hated it. We aim to utilize the relationships of the words in the review to predict the overall polarity of the review.

We were eager to try out our own hands with Sentiment Analysis On Movie Review using machine learning.
 
## Project Implementation 
The purpose of this project was for the model to be able to predict. We have implemented the project with Python in Jupyter notebook.The main aim of this project is to identify the underlying sentiment of a movie review on the basis of its textual information. In this project, we try to classify whether a person liked the movie or not based on the review they give for the movie. This is particularly useful in cases when the creator of a movie wants to measure its overall performance using reviews that critics and viewers are providing for the movie. The outcome of this project can also be used to create a recommender by providing recommendation of movies to viewers on the basis of their previous reviews. Another application of this project would be to find a group of viewers with similar movie tastes (likes or dislikes).
As a part of this project, we aim to study several feature extraction techniques used in text mining e.g. keyword spotting, lexical affinity and statistical methods, and understand their relevance to our problem. In addition to feature extraction, we also look into different classification techniques and explore how well they perform for different kinds of feature representations. We finally draw a conclusion regarding which combination of feature representations and classification techniques are most accurate for the current predictive task.
